COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is a disease caused by a virus named SARS-CoV-2 and was discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan, China.
It is very contagious and has quickly spread around the world. 
COVID-19 most often causes respiratory symptoms that can feel much like a cold, a flu, or pneumonia.
This website visualized the new covid-19 cases on the map.
This covid-19 cases statically interactive map is used to describe the covid-19 cases among the world. 
The size of each circle on the map reflects the total cases in this area.
With this map, we can easily zoom in and out to acquire specific details of the desired area.
As we zoom in, the circle will break down into small circles providing more location information.
Hovering over the circle shows the total number of cases and deaths in its area.
For me, the most attractive feature of this plot is the circle can break down and aggregate as you zoom in and out.
It helps us to see the distribution of the new cases and the amount of the new cases clearly and effectively.
